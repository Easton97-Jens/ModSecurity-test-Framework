## Important Reporting Semantics
- PASS/FAIL are rendered only from live runtime evidence recorded in connector summaries and decision/result artifacts.
- BLOCKED remains reserved for harness, environment, dependency, build, or runtime blockers.
- NOT_EXECUTABLE means the case is structurally unmappable for that connector/run mode; it is not a blocker and not a pass.
- Force-all evidence does not promote YAML feature support.
- RESPONSE_BODY remains experimental/non-promoted, including bounded phase-4 and strict-abort evidence.

## Framework Integration
- This framework-owned file is the source of truth for root coverage reporting: `TEST-COVERAGE-SUMMARY.md` in `ModSecurity-test-Framework`.
- Connector repositories should link to this Framework summary instead of maintaining their own root coverage summary.
- Shared YAML cases, runners, normalizers, generators, and detailed testing documentation are owned by `ModSecurity-test-Framework`.
- The connector repository owns connector source, harnesses, adapter metadata, `config/testing/import-status.json`, and connector-specific generated evidence under `reports/testing/`.
- `FRAMEWORK_ROOT` and `CONNECTOR_ROOT` are explicit integration paths; there is no absolute workspace fallback.

## Case Inventory
- Common YAML cases: **134**
- Apache-specific YAML cases: **0**
- NGINX-specific YAML cases: **7**
- Current XFAIL cases: **0**
- Former XFAIL cases tracked: **80**
- Mapped-only import inventory entries: **10** (not counted as runnable YAML cases)
- Runtime-blocked import inventory entries: **0** (environment/harness blockers, not PASS promotions)
- Pending/future compatibility cases: **17** future/experimental; **141** not runtime-verified

## Framework Check Status
| Command | Status | Details |
|---|---|---|
| make setup-dev | PASS | Development dependencies available in .venv |
| make lint | PASS | Repository lint checks passed |
| make generate-test-matrix | PASS | Generated coverage docs refreshed from current metadata |
| make check-test-matrix | FAIL | Exited 2 in this uncommitted working tree because generated reports differ from HEAD after the HAProxy matrix updates |
| make quick-check | PASS | Lightweight framework checks passed |
| make cloud-quick-check | PASS | Framework/generator-only cloud check passed |
| .venv/bin/python -m py_compile modules/ModSecurity-test-Framework/tests/normalizers/*.py modules/ModSecurity-test-Framework/tests/runners/*.py modules/ModSecurity-test-Framework/ci/*.py | PASS | Framework Python files compiled through the connector module path |
| sh -n ci/*.sh connectors/apache/harness/*.sh connectors/nginx/harness/*.sh | PASS | POSIX shell syntax check passed for connector integration shell scripts |
| bash -n ci/*.sh connectors/apache/harness/*.sh connectors/nginx/harness/*.sh | PASS | Bash syntax check passed for connector integration shell scripts |
| git diff --check | PASS | No whitespace errors reported |
| diff -u /tmp/pre-connector.diff /tmp/post-connector.diff | PASS | Connector source diff snapshot is unchanged; no new connector source changes were introduced |
| git diff --exit-code -- connectors/apache/src connectors/nginx/src | BLOCKED | Non-zero because connectors/apache/src/mod_security3.c had a pre-existing unrelated local change before this fix; the pre/post connector diff snapshot is unchanged |
| git ls-files .venv | PASS | No tracked .venv files |

## Readiness / Fetch Status
| Command | Status | Details |

| make fetch-deps | NOT_RUN | Not rerun during the framework-module migration; runtime-matrix-all used the configured local source tree and build output location |
| optional installed readiness | BLOCKED | System Apache/APXS/NGINX/libmodsecurity readiness remains diagnostic only and is not required for source-build smokes |
| make runtime-matrix-all | PASS | Force-all matrix orchestration completed and recorded Apache/NGINX per-case evidence; expected runtime FAILs remain evidence and are not PASS promotions |

## Connector Runtime Availability
| Connector | Status | Build | Per-case results | Attempted cases | Summary evidence | Note |
|---|---|---|---|---:|---|---|
| Apache | PASS | unknown | available | 54 | /src/ModSecurity-conector-build/results/apache-summary.json | Per-case results are copied from the local smoke summary JSON; they are runtime evidence only. |
| NGINX | PASS | unknown | available | 60 | /src/ModSecurity-conector-build/results/nginx-summary.json | Per-case results are copied from the local smoke summary JSON; they are runtime evidence only. |
| HAProxy | PASS | unknown | available | 55 | /src/ModSecurity-conector-build/results/with-crs/haproxy-summary.json | Default HAProxy evidence is the supported non-former-XFAIL subset of live HAProxy matrix evidence; force-all rows remain separate runtime evidence. |

## Runtime FAIL Details

### Apache FAIL Details
No Apache runtime FAIL details were reported.

### NGINX FAIL Details
No NGINX runtime FAIL details were reported.

### HAProxy FAIL Details
No HAProxy runtime FAIL details were reported.

## Runtime Verified Status
- Runtime matrix records current local Apache, NGINX, and HAProxy per-case smoke evidence when available.
- PASS in this snapshot means the case was executed by that connector's smoke harness and matched the case expectation in the summary JSON.
- Pending, connector-gap, runtime-difference, future, and mapped-only inventory are not promoted by this snapshot.
- FORCE_ALL_CASES=1 attempts all materializable YAML cases where they are applicable to the connector.
- HAProxy PASS is scoped to live HAProxy evidence only; current HAProxy coverage is partial request-side YAML execution.
- RESPONSE_BODY remains non-verified/non-promoted.
- Runtime passed, but this does not verify RESPONSE_BODY support.
- make smoke-all was not run by runtime-matrix; full-smoke PASS counts remain unknown.

## Open Runtime Issues
- Mapped-only import inventory entries are not executable YAML runtime cases.
- Pending/future/connector-gap/runtime-difference topics require live evidence before any support claim.
- RESPONSE_BODY remains experimental/non-verified.

## Open Areas / Gaps
- Runtime verification pending: cases with `runtime_verified=false` or `runtime_verified=unknown` are not runtime PASS proof.
- RESPONSE_BODY remains non-verified and non-promoted.
- GitHub/Codex checks are intentionally lightweight and do not prove runtime compatibility.
- Pending, future, connector-gap, and runtime-difference topics require local runtime evidence before any support claim.
- Runtime-blocked import entries are environment or harness blockers and do not imply connector-gap/runtime-difference promotion.
- `installed-readiness` is diagnostic detection, not runtime execution.
- There is no separate artifact-reuse smoke path; runtime validation uses source-build execution.
- `make smoke-all` is authoritative only when it is actually executed successfully.

## Commands
- `make quick-check`
- `make quick-all`
- `make cloud-quick-check`
- `make installed-readiness`
- `make runtime-matrix`
- `make runtime-matrix-all`
- `make runtime-matrix-haproxy`
- `make smoke-apache`
- `make smoke-nginx`
- `make smoke-haproxy`

## Important Note
Generated coverage is reporting only; it is not runtime evidence by itself.
Full runtime validation is local and evidence-based.
GitHub/Codex checks are intentionally lightweight.
Pending, future, and gap topics need local runtime validation before promotion.
`make smoke-all` is authoritative only if it was actually executed successfully.
No PASS numbers are inferred from this file when `make smoke-all` was not run successfully.
Phase 4 / RESPONSE_BODY remains non-promoted; bounded strict-abort evidence is reported as runtime evidence only.
